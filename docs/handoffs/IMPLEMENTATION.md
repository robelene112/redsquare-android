# Implementation handoff

## Current verification status

Issue #94's prototype-fidelity repair is delivered as signed beta **0.1.102**:
[download or update](https://davidengelen.nl/redsquare/). The public latest pointer,
actual APK checksum and exact immutable notes are verified after promotion.
Frozen source: `1c7cb53d8c077aa1cd132deec22a1c5a72cc2d3c`, tag
`proof-prototype94-loaded-activity`. Production last changed at be37e8c42; later
changes are tests/evidence only, with an exact whole-tree bridge retained.

Both complete runs pass all three partitions: Android 10 [42452255196](https://github.com/robelene112/redsquare-android/actions/runs/42452255196)
and Android 17 [42451092093](https://github.com/robelene112/redsquare-android/actions/runs/42451092093).
The unchanged frozen Android 17 collector confirms 630 identities and no assumptions. The Android 10 collector
confirms 629 identities: 628 passed and the single inherited
API29 Profile assumption. Both catalogs have no missing or extra identities.
Both independent final packet reviews find no actionable defects. No partial or tail assembly is used.
Original 180-second class bounds, 214 classes and 629/630 expected identities remain frozen.

Actual signed 83-to-102 update/isolation passes Android 10 [42454280787](https://github.com/robelene112/redsquare-android/actions/runs/42454280787)
and Android 17 [42454286099](https://github.com/robelene112/redsquare-android/actions/runs/42454286099).
Independent actual artifact and update-native reviews find no actionable defects.
APK: 42,355,754 bytes; SHA256 `616a151011887ba2f19be9cba8fb23d69f33d4b4da15d02bebcc142d1ec14fb7`.
Signing certificate, package, minimum API29 and target API36 and vendored license are verified.
Never promote superseded candidates 93 through 101.

Prototype authority: `c95ecaa01abb71c576f052c7cc2303356416091c`,
`design-3d989e9e8406`, plus owner amendments: rounded named module selector,
real identity/data, separated profile history, compact repeatable heart, exact-post
Activity grouping and collapsing reading header. Do not copy sample identities or
artwork as live data. Stack remains explicitly a local design preview; actual
network/publication/payment/subscription work stays under issue #1.

Current originals, frozen collector results and qualified independent reviews are
in [ticket94 evidence](../evidence/ticket94/README.md). Historical failed executions
remain failed. Known baseline missing failure-only captures are recorded by the
frozen collector; they are not missing application identities or waived goals.
Physical Pixel performance, actual provider delivery, business/policy setup and
Play acceptance remain pending under #36 and [OWNER_INPUTS.md](../../OWNER_INPUTS.md).
Do not automatically close issues #1/#36/#55/#84/#86. Canonical checkout, other work,
production nodes and services remain untouched. Issue #94 is complete. Stop until the owner requests further work.

## Working paths and resume boundary

- Sole implementation checkout: `/mnt/storage/redsquare-android-artifacts/redesign86`,
  branch `codex/unified-redesign`. Preserve canonical `/home/david/projects/redsquare-android`.
- Large raw captures and build/probe logs live under
  `/mnt/storage/redsquare-android-artifacts`; verified additional storage, not root.
- Current run manifest: `prototype94-final-loaded-activity-runs.json` there.
- Exact published artifact: `.scratch/review-builds/102`; notes are
  `prototype94-beta102-notes.txt` in the external artifact root. The public release uses
  those exact immutable notes and APK bytes. Do not rebuild/reserve another version.
- Completion: both collectors, both independent review axes, exact version 102
  promotion and public-pointer/hash checks pass. Final evidence is committed on
  this branch; close only issue #94 and stop.
- Original failed runs, scoped diagnostics and earlier delivery history are in
  ticket94 evidence and Git history. They are not current pending work.
- Read [project context](../PROJECT_CONTEXT.md), [workflow](../WORKFLOW.md),
  [operations](../OPERATIONS.md) and current tracker before future changes.
