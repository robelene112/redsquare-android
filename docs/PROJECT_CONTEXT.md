# Project context

## Desired outcome

Build a professional, fast Android app for Saito's Red Square. Preserve familiar
Red Square navigation and social behavior for existing users. Turn speed and
polish into measurable acceptance criteria during the scope grill.

Performance target: on the owner's Google Pixel 7, a cold launch with cached
posts available reaches an interactive feed within two seconds. Show cached
content first and refresh in the background. Measure first-ever launch
separately: target an interactive feed within five seconds on the same Pixel 7
over stable Wi-Fi. Detailed network conditions and timing boundaries must be
defined in the specification so these targets can be tested consistently.

## Decisions already made

- The app's display name is Red Square. Its application ID and store publisher
  configuration still need to be settled before distribution.
- First-release baseline: the core social experience, including feed, threads,
  posting/replies, likes/reposts, profiles, following, in-app notifications and
  wallet creation/import/export. Additional features are decided individually;
  selecting this baseline does not automatically exclude them.
- Preserve existing Red Square capabilities within the agreed app scope.
  Research and compatibility verification are the agent's responsibility.
  Incomplete research alone must not be used to propose feature deferral.
- Include ordinary reposts and quote posts with commentary/images in the first
  release. Published Saito Red Square source supports both. Match its transaction
  and display semantics while accounting for the deployed redesign's different
  handling; verify native/web interoperability during implementation. Quote-post
  deferral was rejected by the owner. See
  [the complete quote-post trace](research/REDSQUARE_QUOTES.md).
- Include a Following feed showing only accounts the user follows, alongside
  the selected backend's general feed. Both views use that backend's available
  history and respect applicable personal controls and backend moderation.
  Native following behavior must be verified rather than inferred from web UI
  placeholders. See [the inspected baseline](research/REDSQUARE_BASELINE.md).
- Users can edit the text of their own posts and delete their own posts in the
  first release, using compatible signed Red Square actions. Deletion removes
  the post from normal application views; explain that historical or independent
  copies may remain. Edit timing, conflict handling and deletion cache behavior
  need specification. See [the inspected baseline](research/REDSQUARE_BASELINE.md).
- Users can edit their profile banner, bio and custom profile picture inside
  the app in the first release. Keep the generated Saito avatar as the default.
  Preserve compatibility with Saito Profile updates. See
  [the inspected profile features](research/REDSQUARE_PROFILES.md).
- Users can optionally choose and register a Saito username inside the app
  in the first release. Registration must not delay immediate first use.
  Preserve compatibility with Saito Registry; verify its availability and
  registration behavior for both supported backends.
- Attaching and viewing images in posts and replies are included in the first
  release. Attachment formats, limits and other media types remain open.
- The first release includes the Red Square GIF search and picker supplied by
  Giphy, for composing posts and replies. See
  [the inspected web media features](research/REDSQUARE_MEDIA.md).
- YouTube links in posts support playback inside the app in the first release,
  preserving the web experience's embedded videos. Playback begins only when
  the user taps; videos must not autoplay.
- Offline reading of cached posts and saving drafts are included in the first
  release. Posts and Chat messages explicitly sent while offline queue for
  automatic delivery when connectivity returns, with a visible Queued status
  and cancellation before sending. Saved drafts remain unsent until the user
  presses Send. This decision does not authorize queued SAITO transfers.
- Queued posts and Chat messages remain tied to the backend selected when
  the user pressed Send. Switching backends pauses those items until their
  original backend is selected again; switching must not reroute them.
- Show a small, non-blocking banner at the top with a red dot while disconnected.
  On reconnection, briefly show a green dot and "Back online", then hide the
  banner. Preserve feed position and composed work. Distinguish loss of internet
  from an unreachable selected backend so the banner describes the actual
  condition. Report recovery only when that condition has cleared.
- Product text must not use em dashes. Use plain punctuation throughout the app.
- The first-release interface is English, structured to add translations later.
  User posts and messages can use any language and punctuation; the app's copy
  conventions must not rewrite user content.
- Optional Android push notifications for replies and mentions are included in
  the first release, including delivery while the app is closed. The delivery
  infrastructure and initial notification defaults remain open.
- Ask for notification permission when someone first opens Chat or Notifications,
  with an option to skip. First launch must still open directly into the feed.
- New Chat messages also support push notifications, with controls to mute
  individual conversations inside Chat. Android system settings control the
  notification categories, accessible through a shortcut in the app. Categories
  distinguish replies, mentions, private chats and group chats.
- Private-chat notifications show "New message" by default. Users can opt in
  to message previews. Verify notification payloads and rendering preserve this
  privacy choice, including when the app is closed.
- Searching for posts and people is included in the first release. Search
  coverage and behavior depend on the selected backend's available data and
  still need to be defined.
- Personal controls to mute or block accounts are included in the first release,
  alongside backend moderation. The active wallet's personal mute and block
  choices apply on both supported backends; switching servers must not undo
  them. Backup/recovery behavior and remaining display details need specification.
- Account muting hides that account's posts and notifications while keeping
  Chat messages accessible. Account blocking also hides incoming Chat messages
  from the account. Explain these effects briefly where users choose the action
  and where they manage muted/blocked accounts. Distinguish account muting from
  conversation muting, which silences that conversation's notifications while
  keeping its messages visible. See
  [the inspected moderation behavior](research/REDSQUARE_MODERATION.md).
- Reporting posts for moderation is included in the first release. Report
  to the currently selected backend's moderators, with the destination clearly
  shown before submission. Submission acknowledgement and handling still need
  specification; reporting is not an automatic removal rule.
- Saito Chat integration is included in the first release, preserving its place
  in the familiar web Red Square experience. It includes private one-to-one
  conversations and group chats. Remaining Chat behavior and native
  interoperability requirements still need specification. See
  [the inspected chat integration](research/REDSQUARE_CHAT.md).
- Users can create named group chats, invite people and manage membership inside
  the first-release app. Follow Saito Chat's existing permissions: members can
  view membership and leave; admins can remove members and appoint additional
  admins. Verify invitation and membership-update interoperability. See
  [the inspected group capabilities](research/REDSQUARE_BASELINE.md).
- Match Saito Chat's existing privacy model in the first release: encrypted
  private one-to-one conversations, with group chats clearly labelled as
  unencrypted. Preserve protocol compatibility and verify native encryption
  behavior; this decision does not claim forward secrecy or complete history
  recovery from wallet import.
- Chat supports sending and viewing image and GIF messages in the first release,
  preserving compatibility with existing Saito Chat messages. Arbitrary live
  file transfer is a separate integration, not included by this media decision.
- First-release Chat history combines locally cached messages with available
  history recoverable from the selected backend or compatible peers, using the
  imported wallet's available conversation information and decryption keys.
  Archives may retain messages beyond active-chain retention. Preserve cached
  messages through ordinary updates and outages, including messages the backend
  no longer serves. Explain missing older history without promising permanent
  availability or complete recovery after reinstalling or changing phones.
  Guaranteed complete history migration and a separate complete-history backup
  are deferred. Cache retention and identity isolation need specification.
- Native Android in Kotlin. The UI framework and supporting libraries remain
  open; Kotlin does not itself settle those choices.
- Support Android 10 and newer in the first release. Verify the minimum version
  alongside the owner's Pixel 7 running Android 17 during the initial milestone.
- Support light and dark themes, following Android's system setting by default.
  Users can override the theme inside the app.
- Design the app to add further Saito modules, such as Saito Stack, without
  rebuilding shared wallet identity and backend connectivity. Red Square and
  Chat should have distinct feature boundaries. Stack is a future extension
  example; implementing it in the first release has not been requested. See
  [the extensibility decision](adr/0001-shared-saito-foundation.md).
- iOS is deferred. A later iOS app would be a separate Swift implementation.
- User wallet creation, import and export are in scope. Wallet identity and
  local data must survive ordinary in-place app updates.
- The first release supports one active wallet per installation, shared by
  Red Square and Chat. Importing a replacement wallet requires a clear,
  explicit confirmation before replacing the active identity.
- Use the current Snake app's wallet import safeguards as the baseline:
  validate the file and key pair before mutation, preview a same-wallet restore
  versus a different-wallet switch, and require a fresh outgoing-wallet backup
  before replacement when its balance is positive or unknown. With a verified
  zero balance, strongly recommend backup but allow skipping it. Bind backup
  confirmation to the outgoing identity and selected import file. Require
  acknowledgement when a registered name or pending/unknown work belongs to
  the outgoing identity. Failed imports must preserve or restore the previous
  wallet, and success must verify the saved and active identities agree.
  Apply the already-agreed Android device authentication to wallet exports.
  Snake-specific receipt checks need corresponding Android/Saito checks rather
  than introducing Snake game features into this app. See
  [the inspected Snake safeguards](research/SNAKE_WALLET_SAFEGUARDS.md).
- The first-release wallet also displays balances and supports sending and
  receiving SAITO. Sending SAITO and exporting the wallet require system device
  authentication using supported biometrics or the phone's PIN. Transfer
  sending requires a live connection and a final confirmation showing the
  recipient, amount and fee before device authentication. SAITO transfers do
  not use the offline post/Chat queue. Unavailable-authentication handling,
  transfer status and error behavior still need specification.
- A fresh installation opens directly into the feed, creates a local wallet
  automatically, and offers a clearly visible import-existing-wallet option.
  Reading does not require completing a setup wizard.
- Users can begin posting and chatting without a mandatory backup step.
  Offer a dismissible backup reminder and clearly available export/recovery
  guidance. Seamless first use is an acceptance requirement: wallet creation
  must not introduce a setup wizard or block UI interaction. Actual cold-start
  timing and fresh-wallet delivery must be verified on Android. See
  [the inspected first-use prerequisites](research/FIRST_USE.md).
- Wallets are non-custodial: signing keys belong on the user's device. Never
  upload private wallet material to the VPS or GitHub.
- Preserve compatibility with existing Saito wallet and Red Square behavior;
  prove native signing and transaction interoperability rather than assuming it.
- The first release includes choosing between `https://saito.davidengelen.nl`
  and `https://saito.io`, with `https://saito.davidengelen.nl` selected by default
  on a fresh installation. Switching keeps the same wallet and identity without
  reimporting. These are the only selectable backends in the first release;
  users cannot configure a custom backend. Wallet imports must not silently
  add or select another backend. Feed switching behavior and control placement
  remain open. Archives and moderation can differ between backends.
- Keep the selected backend during an outage. Do not automatically fall back
  to the other server. Users can still choose to switch manually.
- Block production is deferred and is not an Android backend prerequisite.
- Use Matt Pocock's project-local skills. Implement tickets sequentially,
  without Ralph or parallel ticket implementation.

## Review and distribution goals

The owner's primary physical review device is a Google Pixel 7 running
Android 17, as reported by the owner. Plan for a stable review link with
build notes and an installable update; screenshots or video can assist review.
Updates should install over the same application and preserve its wallet.
Signing identity, application ID, versioning, backup behavior and device checks
must therefore be settled before delivery automation is claimed complete.

The owner delegated the review channel choice to whichever is easiest to iterate
on. Start with signed APK review builds at a stable link, with build notes and
an in-app update notice linking to the latest review build. One-time installation
permission for the browser/download source and ordinary Android installation
confirmation are acceptable for development review. Keep package identity,
signing and versioning consistent and verify wallet/local-data continuity.
Plan signing compatibility for later Google Play distribution before the first
review installation. Use Play internal testing when its setup makes it useful;
it is not a prerequisite for the initial development loop. See
[the reviewed distribution options](research/PLAY_REVIEW_DISTRIBUTION.md).

Google Play is the intended public distribution channel. APK distribution is
also an option. Store accounts, eligibility and submission policy must be
verified against current official sources when release work begins.

## Initial review milestone

The first reviewable build prioritizes local wallet creation/import and a live
Red Square feed from either supported backend, including backend selection.
Prove native Saito connectivity and identity compatibility before adding posting,
Chat and the rest of the accepted release scope. Apply the agreed wallet import
safeguards and use this build to start physical-device performance verification.
This is a delivery priority, not a reduction of the first-release feature scope
or authorization to bypass the subsequent specification and ticket phases.

## Decisions still open

- Attachment details, notification delivery design, search semantics, personal
  moderation behavior, report handling, Chat feature scope and other individual
  features need explicit release boundaries.
- Wallet storage, recovery, import/export format and replacement behavior.
- Native Saito integration approach and any required backend adapter.
- Remaining backend switching behavior and selector placement.
- UI toolkit, architecture and remaining performance targets.
- Application ID, release signing and review delivery implementation.
