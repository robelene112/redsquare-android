## First protocol increment c102f89...7dbaba3

### Standards

Confirmed case-sensitive imported passphrase compatibility defect: converting
accepted uppercase saved aes_secret to bytes and back to lowercase changes
CryptoJS KDF input. Preserve the original validated string and add an
independently signed uppercase fixture. A second documented compatibility finding: formatter fields are coerced via
asString, allowing single-element arrays. Require actual string primitives
and verify correctly signed malformed formatter rejection. Zero actionable
Fowler smells; both findings cite CODING_STANDARDS compatibility rule.

### Spec

Two findings against imported history recovery/string passphrase compatibility:
legacy publickey field is ignored despite pinned keychain migration; accepted
uppercase/mixed-case saved aes_secret is normalized. Preserve backup contents
while selecting the compatible field/passphrase and verify independent vectors.
All26 evidence hashes, three reference copies and core77 counts verified.
UI/transport/final recovery acceptance remains pending, not claimed.
